Format: NameOfRelation(formal parameters). the order of the parameters defines
the going into and out of arrows in a relation.
Descriptions of each relation define the concept type of the last arc that
belongs to the relation.

- Agent;Agnt(Act, Animate): An active animate entitiy that voluntarily initiates an act.
- Attribute;Attr(Object, Entity): An entity that is a property of some object.
[Rhino: Otto] -> (Attr) -> [Orange]
- Beneficiary;Benf(Act, Animate): A beneficiary is a recipient of some act. The
 beneficiary also derives a benefit from the successful completion of the act.
- Characteristic;Chrc(Entity, Entity): A type whose instances are properties of
  entities.
[Rhino: Otto] -> (Chrc) -> [Color: Orange]
The arc pointing away from Chrc must point to a concept which has a type whose
instances are properties. eg. Color is a type but not a property. Color's
instances are properties, such as Orange or Red.

The arc pointing away from Attr must point to a concept whose type is a
property, eg Red. Thus Attr would not point to a concept of type Color but to
concepts with types such as Red, Good, Wise etc.

- Completion;Cmpl(TemporalProcess, Physical): A goal of a completed process
  whose major tenet is that it takes place over time. This can be a state or a
situation.

- Destination;Dest(SpatialProcess, Physical): A goal of a process whose major
  tenet is that it is spatial.
[Go] -> (Dest) -> [Bar]
- Duration;Dur(State, Interval): The interval in which a state exists.
[Wait] -> (Dur) -> [Interval: @10 min] /* Wait for 10 minutes */
- Effector;Efct(Entity, Entity): An active entity (animate or inanimate) that
  initiates an action, but without voluntary intention.
[Tree] <- (Efct) <- [Produce] -> (Rslt) -> [Fruit]
- Experiencer;Expr(State, Animate): An animate entity who experiences a state.
  The state is often a verb of perception, such as "see", "hear", "think", etc.
- Role; Has(Entity, Entity): The Has relation is a primitive relation (not
  defined). It is used to define all of the relations, and can be used by
itself.
[Person: @every] -> (Has) -> [Part: @2 legs]
- Instrument;Inst(Act, Entity): An instrument used in an act. The instrument is
  not changed by the activity.
- Location;Loc(Physical, Physical): The place where something is or takes
  place.
- Manner;Manr(Process, Entity): An entity that is a property of some process. In
  English, we often use adverbs to describe manners, e.g. quickly, slowly, etc.
- Measure;Meas(Attribute, Quantity): A quantity used to describe an attribute.
  In English, the attribute will often be an adjective such as "clever", "fat",
etc. The quantity will either be a measure or a degree or the like.
[Clever] -> (Meas) -> [Degree: #very]
[Part: #dick] -> (Meas) -> [Measure: @6 inch]
- Origin;Orgn(Process, Physical): A physical participant in a process which is
  the source or originator of the process.
- Part;Part(Object, Object): An object which is a component/part of some other
  object. [Body] -> (Part) -> [Leg]
There is a very important distinction between an attribute and a part: Unlike an
attribute, a part is capable of existing independently. For eg, a wheel is
capable of existing independently of the car of which it is a part of. However,
if the car is white, that is an attribute of the car, which cannot exist
independently of the car.
- Path;Path(Process, Place): A path describing a process.
[Travel] -> (Path) -> [Country: USA]
- Possession;Poss(Animate, Entity): An entity owned by some animate being.
- PointInTime;PTim(Physical, Time): An essential participant of a temporal
  togetherness (nexus).
[Time: 5:15pm] <- (PTim) <- [Situation: [Person] <- (Agnt) <- [Leave]]
- Patient;Ptnt(Process, Physical): A participant in a process that undergoes a
  change during the course of the process.
- Recipient;Rcpt(Act, Animate): An animate goal of an act.
- Result;Rslt(Process, Entity): An inanimate goal of an act.
- Theme;Thme(Situation, Entity): A participant that may be moved, said, or
  experienced, but is not structurally changed.
[Person: Alfred] <- (Agnt) <- [Drive] -> (Thme) -> [Car: #Fiat]
