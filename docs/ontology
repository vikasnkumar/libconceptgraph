These are categories from Top Level Ontology as per Sowa's KR Book
- Entity
- 
  - Independent: [Entity] an entity characterized by some inherent firstness,
    independent of any relationships it may have to other entities
  - Relative: [Entity] An entity in a relationship to some other entity.
    Relative is a primitive for which the HAS test must apply. For any relative
X, there must exist some Y such that X has Y or Y has X.
  - Mediating: [Entity] An entity characterized by some thirdness that brings
    other entities into a relationship. An independent entity need not have a
relationship to anything else, a relative entity must have some relationship to
something else, and a mediating entity creates a relationship between two other
entities.
- 
  - Physical: [Entity] An entity that has a location in space-time. Anything
    physical is located in some place. Anything physical occurs at some point in
time.
  - Abstract: [Entity] Pure information as distinguished from any particular
    encoding of the information in a physical medium. 
- 
  - Continuant: [Entity] An entity whose identity continues to be recognizable
    over some extended interval of time. A continuant x has only spatial parts
and no temporal parts. At any time t when x exists, all of x exists at the same
time t. New parts of a continuant x may be acquired and old parts may be lost.
Parts that have been lost may cease to exist, but everything that remains a part
of x continues to exist at the same time as x. The identity conditions of a
continuant are independent of time. A physical continuant is an object, and an
abstract continuant is a schema used to characterize some object.
  - Occurrent: [Entity] An entity that does not have a stable identity during any
    interval of time. The temporal parts of an occurrent, called stages, exist
at different times. The spatial parts of an occurrent, called participants, may
exist at the same time, but an occurrent may have different participants at
different stages. No identity conditions that can be used to identify two
occurrents that are observed in nonoverlapping space-time regions. eg. person's
lifetime is occurrent.
- Actuality: [ Independent Physical] A physical entity whose existence is
  independent of any other entity.
- Form: [Independent Abstract] Abstract information independent of any encoding
  or embodiment. Forms can exist in the same sense as math objects such as sets
and relations, but instances of form cannot exist at a particular place and time
without some physical encoding or embodiment.
- Prehension: [Physical Relative] A physical entity relative to some entity or
  entities. The HAS test is used to check whether an entity X prehends an entity
Y. Prehension = HAS(X, Y).
- Proposition: [Relative Abstract] An abstraction that relates some entity or
  entities. 
- Nexus: [Physical Mediating] A physical entity mediating two or more other
  entities. An action that consists of what one participant/agent is doing to
another participant/patient.
- Intention: [Abstract Mediating] Abstraction considered as mediating other
  entities. eg. hopes, fears, wishes, purposes
- [Abstract Occurrent]
- [Relative Continuant]
- Object: [Independent Continuant Physical] Actuality considered as a continuant
  which retains its identity over some interval of time.
- Juncture: [Relative Continuant Physical] A prehension considered as a
  continuant during some interval.
- Structure: [Mediating Continuant Physical] A nexus considered as a continuant.
  A structure mediates multiple objects whose junctures constitute the
structure.
- Process: [Independent Occurrent Physical] Actuality considered as an Occurrent
  during the interval of interest. Depending on time scale and level of detail,
the same actual entity may be viewed as a stable object or a dynamic process.
- Participation: [Relative Occurrent Physical] A prehension considered as an
  occurent during the interval of interest. The prehending entity is a process,
and the prehended entity is a participant.
- Situation: [Mediating Occurrent Physical] A nexus considered as an occurrent.
  A situation mediates the participants of some process, whose stages may
involve different participants at different times.
- Schema:[Independent Continuant Abstract] A form that has the structure of a
  continuant. A schema is an abstract form whose structure does not specify time
or time-like relationships. eg. Encoding, syntax, geometry
- Description: [Relative Continuant Abstract] A proposition about a continuant
  that states how some schema characterizes some aspect or configuration of a
continuant. 
- Reason: [Mediating Continuant Abstract] Intention that has the form of a
  continuant. Unlike a simple description (Secondness), a reason explains an
entity in terms of an intention (Thirdness).
- Script:[Independent Occurrent Abstract] A form that has the structure of an
  occurrent. A script is an abstract form that represents time sequences. eg,
recipe, program, sheet music
- History: [Relative Occurrent Abstract] A proposition about an occurrent. A
  history is a proposition that relates some script to the stages of some
occurrent. 
- Purpose: [Mediating Occurrent Abstract] Intention that has the form of an
  occurrent. Time sequence, contingency, success/failure. Agents.
- Absurdity: [Independent Relative Mediating Continuant Abstract Occurrent Physical]

Everything is an instance of Entity.
Every type is a subtype of Entity
Anything that exists is of type Entity.
Nothing is an instance of Absurdity.
Every type is a supertype of Absurdity.
